# PeelXML
iPython notebook that pulls metadata from a directory of XML files.

This code uses XPath to extract specific metadata from a directory of 13,472 XML files.

I describe this code as a ‘brute force’ attack, meaning that the resulting CSV file requires a small amount of cleanup to remove brackets and quotation marks. For this reason the code continues to be _under development_ and may be subject to change in order to increase the elegance and functionality. But it works.

The XML files for the Peel’s Prairie Provinces Historical Postcards can be downloaded from the [University of Alberta Libraries Dataverse](https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/dvn/dv/UAL).

The postcards themselves can be viewed at the [Peel’s Prairie Provinces webpage](http://peel.library.ualberta.ca/collections.html).
