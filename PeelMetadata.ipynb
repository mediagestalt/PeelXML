    "This code extracts the metadata from the Peel's Prarie Provinces Historical Postcards. The full data set (consisting of 13,472 unique records) can be downloaded from the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.7939/DVN/10709\" target=\"_blank\">University of Alberta Libraries Dataverse</a>. Information about the Peel's Prairie Provinces Historical Postcards project (including photographs of the postcards themselves) can be found <a href=\"http://peel.library.ualberta.ca/collections.html\" target=\"_blank\">at this link</a>.\n",

    "In all honesty, this code takes a 'brute force' approach to extracting the data, meaning that the resulting CSV file requires some modest cleanup. This mostly involves removing quotations and square brackets, though there are a number of records (between 50-100) that are a bit messier. This is due to multiple records existing within one XML file. For these reasons, this code remains a work-in-progress that may be updated periodically. \n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, the code works. It extracts a selection of information from the XML file containing the metatdata. These information include: postcard ID, date, city, province, country, postcard title, photograph URL, subject terms, and the names and roles of the producers or photographers. The XML file do contain some other fields and these can be easily added to the code, following the conventions of the existing code. The extraction is accomplished using <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/xsl/xpath_intro.asp\" target=\"_blank\">XPath</a>, which is a syntax that defines parts of XML documents. "
